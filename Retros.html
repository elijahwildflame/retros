<H2>Retros 1</H2>
    <p>today lesson was enjoyable since we learned the commands that can be used by porgramers. while sometimes difficult to understand due to talking fast roger makes the
lesson fun by giving examples of what he is explaing. the lesson was annoying since the laoptop i have been using had not installed Ubuntu and i had to use
/Roger's for half the lesson the switch to mine.</p>
